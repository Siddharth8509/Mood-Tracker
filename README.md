# 🎭 Mood Tracker - Project Overview

**Mood Tracker** is a simple web-based application that allows users to **log their daily moods** and track emotional trends over time. The goal of this project is to provide users with an easy way to **record and visualize** their emotions, helping them better understand their mental well-being.  

This project was built using:

## 🏗 How I Built the Mood Tracker  

### **1️⃣ Planning the Project**  
Before writing any code, I planned the project by outlining the main **requirements and features**:  
✔ Users should be able to **select a mood emoji** (😊 😢 😐 😍 😝).  
✔ The selected mood should be **stored** and remain saved even after refreshing the page.  
✔ A timeline should display **past moods**, allowing users to track their emotional trends.  
✔ There should be an option to **clear logs** with a confirmation message.

## 🏗 Development Process  

### **🔹 Structuring the UI with HTML**  
I created the basic structure using **HTML**. The page includes:  
- **Mood selection buttons** for different emotions.  
- A **display section** to show the selected mood.  
- A **log history section** where past moods are displayed.  
- A **delete button** to allow users to clear their mood logs.  

### **🔹 Styling with CSS**  
To enhance the look and feel of the website, I used **CSS** to:  
✔ Align and style the **mood buttons**.  
✔ Create a **clean and user-friendly UI**.  
✔ Ensure the website **adapts to different screen sizes** using **media queries**.  

### **🔹 Adding Interactivity with JavaScript**  
I implemented **JavaScript** to:  
✔ Capture user mood selections.  
✔ Store data in **LocalStorage** for persistence.  
✔ Display past moods dynamically.  
✔ Allow users to **delete logs with confirmation**.
